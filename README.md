# Wine-Prediction-using-Random-Forest-Classifier

## Objectives
The aim of this machine learning project is to build a machine learning model to predict the quality of wines by exploring the various chemical properties available in wine. After data visualisation technique or data plotting that will serve as an input to a machine learning model.
